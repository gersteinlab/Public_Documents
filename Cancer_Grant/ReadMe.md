In the past year, we have worked on developing the Function-based Prioritization of Sequence Variants (FunSeq) tool for the prioritization of somatic cancer variants on the basis of their overlap with important functional elements (Khurana et al. 2013a). We have also investigated interaction network disruptions in cancer, including the transcription factor (TF) and nuclear receptor (NR) regulatory networkâ€™s role in breast cancer (Kittler et al. 2013), as well as the place of essential and loss-of-function (LoF) tolerant genes in a Multinet consisting of protein-protein interaction (PPI), phosphorylation, metabolic, signaling, genetic, and regulatory network data (Khurana et al. 2013b). Furthermore, we have explored the interaction between miR-31 expression and androgen receptor regulation in prostate cancer (Lin et al. 2012). Finally, we have investigated somatic copy number mosaicism in primary human skin fibroblasts (Abyzov et al. 2012). This work has brought attention to the extent of somatic variation in human cells, which is relevant to understanding the rise of genetic diseases such as cancer. In the future, we have plans to develop a companion tool to FunSeq called Large-scale Analysis of Recurrent Variants in Annotations (LARVA), for the discovery of functional elements that are recurrently mutated across many cancer patients.
